Project Overview

The art gallery in our neighbourhood has always done business the old-fashioned way: connecting local artists with potential customers by showcasing their work at the gallery. The current pandemic is forcing them to change their business model and focus their business online. They hired you to help them design a new software system for them.

The gallery wants to focus on local artists and encourage them to use their website and app to promote and sell their work. Artists register, create a profile, and present any pieces they have to sell. Interested customers can browse and buy what they like. The gallery can also promote artwork available on their premises. Artists can deliver their art to customers by mail or can leave it at the store for pickup. The gallery makes its income on commission from sold artwork.
